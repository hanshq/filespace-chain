**Time**: 12:50:53
**Feature**: Export hosting contract data to CSV

## User Request

Export hosting contract data to CSV

## Context

This request involves creating functionality to export hosting contract data from the Filespace Chain blockchain to CSV format. Hosting contracts are agreements between inquiry and offer parties in the file storage and hosting system.

## Initial Understanding

The user wants to be able to export hosting contract data to a CSV file format, likely for analysis, reporting, or integration with external systems.

## Questions for Clarification

1. Which specific fields from the hosting contract should be included in the CSV export?
2. Should the export include all hosting contracts or support filtering (by date, creator, status, etc.)?
3. Where should the CSV export functionality be implemented (CLI command, API endpoint, both)?
4. Should related data (file entries, hosting inquiries, hosting offers) be included or just the contract data?
5. What is the intended use case for the exported data?
6. Are there any specific CSV formatting requirements (delimiter, encoding, headers)?
7. Should the export support pagination for large datasets?
