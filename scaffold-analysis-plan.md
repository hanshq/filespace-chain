# TestScaffold Type Analysis Plan

## Objective
Use the ignite scaffold command to create a new `testScaffold` type and analyze how it differs from our custom protobuf types (`EscrowRecord`, `ProviderStake`) to identify missing entries and ensure completeness.

## Phase 1: Pre-Scaffold Baseline
### 1.1 Document Current State
- [ ] Create snapshot of current file structure
- [ ] Document existing custom types in `payment.proto`:
  - `EscrowRecord` (inquiry_id, amount, creator)
  - `ProviderStake` (provider, amount, height)
- [ ] Document existing query methods in `query.proto`
- [ ] List current gRPC handler files

### 1.2 Identify Key Areas to Monitor
- [ ] Proto files: `proto/filespacechain/filespacechain/*.proto`
- [ ] Generated types: `x/filespacechain/types/*.pb.go`
- [ ] Query handlers: `x/filespacechain/keeper/query_*.go`
- [ ] CRUD operations: `x/filespacechain/keeper/msg_server_*.go`
- [ ] Type definitions: `x/filespacechain/types/messages_*.go`
- [ ] Test files: `x/filespacechain/keeper/*_test.go`

## Phase 2: Execute Scaffold Command
### 2.1 Run Scaffold Command
```bash
ignite scaffold type testScaffold field1:string field2:uint64 field3:coin
```

### 2.2 Track File Changes
- [ ] Use `git diff --name-only` to identify all changed files
- [ ] Use `git diff --stat` to see change statistics
- [ ] Document new files created
- [ ] Document existing files modified

## Phase 3: Detailed Analysis
### 3.1 Proto File Analysis
- [ ] Examine `proto/filespacechain/filespacechain/testScaffold.proto` (if created)
- [ ] Check changes to `query.proto` for new query methods
- [ ] Check changes to `tx.proto` for new transaction messages
- [ ] Compare message structure with our custom types

### 3.2 Generated Code Analysis
- [ ] Examine `x/filespacechain/types/testScaffold.pb.go`
- [ ] Check updates to `query.pb.go` and `tx.pb.go`
- [ ] Analyze message validation methods
- [ ] Document protobuf serialization methods

### 3.3 Keeper Implementation Analysis
- [ ] Examine CRUD operations in `keeper/testScaffold.go`
- [ ] Check query handlers in `keeper/query_testScaffold.go`
- [ ] Analyze message server methods in `keeper/msg_server_testScaffold.go`
- [ ] Review storage key management

### 3.4 Type Definition Analysis
- [ ] Examine `types/messages_testScaffold.go`
- [ ] Check message validation logic
- [ ] Analyze route and type constants
- [ ] Review error handling

### 3.5 Test Coverage Analysis
- [ ] Examine `keeper/testScaffold_test.go`
- [ ] Check `keeper/msg_server_testScaffold_test.go`
- [ ] Review test patterns and coverage

## Phase 4: Comparison with Custom Types
### 4.1 Structure Comparison
- [ ] Compare `testScaffold` proto definition with `EscrowRecord`
- [ ] Compare `testScaffold` proto definition with `ProviderStake`
- [ ] Identify differences in field types and annotations

### 4.2 Query Method Comparison
- [ ] Compare scaffold-generated queries with our custom queries
- [ ] Check for missing CRUD operations in custom types
- [ ] Identify query patterns we might have missed

### 4.3 gRPC Handler Comparison
- [ ] Compare scaffold gRPC handlers with `grpc_query_extended.go`
- [ ] Check for missing validation logic
- [ ] Identify patterns for error handling and response formatting

### 4.4 Message Server Comparison
- [ ] Check if custom types need CRUD message servers
- [ ] Compare transaction handling patterns
- [ ] Identify missing business logic integration

## Phase 5: Gap Analysis
### 5.1 Missing Proto Features
- [ ] Check if custom types need full CRUD proto definitions
- [ ] Verify field annotations (gogoproto, validation)
- [ ] Assess need for transaction messages

### 5.2 Missing Implementation Features
- [ ] Identify missing storage operations
- [ ] Check for missing validation logic
- [ ] Assess pagination support needs

### 5.3 Missing Query Features
- [ ] Compare query completeness (Get, List, custom queries)
- [ ] Check pagination implementation
- [ ] Identify missing query parameters

### 5.4 Missing Test Coverage
- [ ] Identify tests needed for custom types
- [ ] Check unit test patterns
- [ ] Assess integration test needs

## Phase 6: Recommendations
### 6.1 Immediate Actions
- [ ] List required additions to custom types
- [ ] Identify critical missing functionality
- [ ] Prioritize implementation tasks

### 6.2 Implementation Strategy
- [ ] Create implementation plan for missing features
- [ ] Identify dependencies and order of operations
- [ ] Estimate effort and complexity

### 6.3 Best Practices
- [ ] Document patterns to follow
- [ ] Identify code generation opportunities
- [ ] Create templates for future custom types

## Phase 7: Cleanup and Documentation
### 7.1 Remove Test Scaffold
- [ ] Delete testScaffold-related files
- [ ] Revert scaffold changes
- [ ] Restore clean state

### 7.2 Document Findings
- [ ] Create detailed comparison report
- [ ] List specific missing features
- [ ] Provide implementation recommendations

### 7.3 Update Implementation
- [ ] Implement critical missing features
- [ ] Add missing tests
- [ ] Update documentation

## Deliverables
1. **File Change Report**: Complete list of files modified by scaffold command
2. **Feature Comparison Matrix**: Side-by-side comparison of scaffold vs custom types
3. **Gap Analysis Report**: Detailed list of missing features and functionality
4. **Implementation Roadmap**: Prioritized plan for adding missing features
5. **Best Practices Guide**: Patterns and templates for future custom types

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All scaffold-generated files identified and analyzed
- [ ] Complete comparison between scaffold and custom types
- [ ] Comprehensive list of missing features compiled
- [ ] Clear implementation plan created
- [ ] Custom types enhanced with missing critical features

## Notes
- Focus on identifying patterns and best practices from Ignite CLI
- Pay special attention to storage operations and query patterns
- Consider whether full CRUD operations are needed for custom types
- Evaluate the trade-off between manual implementation and scaffold generation
